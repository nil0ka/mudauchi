# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**mudauchi** - An experimental repository for generating interesting commit hashes.

The repository name and README suggest this is a project that creates commits until finding commit hashes with interesting patterns or characteristics.

## Repository State

This is currently a minimal repository with no code implementation. The repository contains only:
- README.md with project description (in Japanese)
- LICENSE file
- Git configuration

## Development Setup

No build tools, dependencies, or development commands are currently configured.

When implementing this project, common approaches might include:
- A script to generate commits with varying content
- Logic to evaluate commit hash patterns
- Cleanup mechanism to manage repository size during iteration
